# RORM Documentation

rorm is a multi-language orm (object-relation-manager).

It is heavily inspired by the excellent orm of the django webframework.

There are currently two versions:

- [dorm](dorm/): for the D programming language
- [rorm](rorm/getting_started): for the rust programming language
